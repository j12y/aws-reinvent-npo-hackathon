# AWS re:Invent NPO Hackathon 2018

## How to Deploy API

* Node setup: Assuming you have Node Version, `nvm install v8.10.0` and npm install -g serverless
* AWS setup: Serverless will use your AWS creds. For now (it's a hackathon) use an account with Admin.
* From the `evaluate-image-api` directory run `serverless deploy -v`
